> The latest stable version of the DuckDB R client is {{ site.current_duckdb_r_version }}.

## Installation

### `duckdb`: R Client

The DuckDB R client can be installed using the following command:

```r
install.packages("duckdb")
```

Please see the [installation page]({% link install/index.html %}?environment=r) for details.

### `duckplyr`: dplyr Client

DuckDB offers a [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)-compatible API via the `duckplyr` package. It can be installed using `install.packages("duckplyr")`. For details, see the [`duckplyr` documentation](https://tidyverse.github.io/duckplyr/).

## Reference Manual

The reference manual for the DuckDB R client is available at [r.duckdb.org](https://r.duckdb.org).

## Basic Client Usage

The standard DuckDB R client implements the [DBI interface](https://cran.r-project.org/package=DBI) for R. If you are not familiar with DBI yet, see the [Using DBI page](https://solutions.rstudio.com/db/r-packages/DBI/) for an introduction.

### Startup & Shutdown

To use DuckDB, you must first create a connection object that represents the database. The connection object takes as parameter the database file to read and write from. If the database file does not exist, it will be created (the file extension may be `.db`, `.duckdb`, or anything else). The special value `:memory:` (the default) can be used to create an **in-memory database**. Note that for an in-memory database no data is persisted to disk (i.e., all data is lost when you exit the R process). If you would like to connect to an existing database in read-only mode, set the `read_only` flag to `TRUE`. Read-only mode is required if multiple R processes want to access the same database file at the same time.

```r
library("duckdb")
# to start an in-memory database
con ?", list(400))
print(res)
# item
# 1 laptop
```

> Warning Do **not** use prepared statements to insert large amounts of data into DuckDB. See below for better options.

## Efficient Transfer

To write a R data frame into DuckDB, use the standard DBI function `dbWriteTable()`. This creates a table in DuckDB and populates it with the data frame contents. For example:

```r
dbWriteTable(con, "iris_table", iris)
res DuckDB keeps a reference to the R data frame after registration. This prevents the data frame from being garbage-collected. The reference is cleared when the connection is closed, but can also be cleared manually using the `duckdb_unregister()` method.

Also refer to the [data import documentation]({% link docs/stable/data/overview.md %}) for more options of efficiently importing data.

## dbplyr

DuckDB also plays well with the [dbplyr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dbplyr) / [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org) packages for programmatic query construction from R. Here is an example:

```r
library("duckdb")
library("dplyr")
con
 group_by(dest) |>
 summarise(delay = mean(dep_time, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
 collect()
```

When using dbplyr, CSV and Parquet files can be read using the `dplyr::tbl` function.

```r
# Establish a CSV for the sake of this example
write.csv(mtcars, "mtcars.csv")

# Summarize the dataset in DuckDB to avoid reading the entire CSV into R's memory
tbl(con, "mtcars.csv") |>
 group_by(cyl) |>
 summarise(across(disp:wt, .fns = mean)) |>
 collect()
```

```r
# Establish a set of Parquet files
dbExecute(con, "COPY flights TO 'dataset' (FORMAT parquet, PARTITION_BY (year, month))")

# Summarize the dataset in DuckDB to avoid reading 12 Parquet files into R's memory
tbl(con, "read_parquet('dataset/**/*.parquet', hive_partitioning = true)") |>
 filter(month == "3") |>
 summarise(delay = mean(dep_time, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
 collect()
```

## Memory Limit

You can use the [`memory_limit` configuration option]({% link docs/stable/configuration/pragmas.md %}) to limit the memory use of DuckDB, e.g.:

```sql
SET memory_limit = '2GB';
```

Note that this limit is only applied to the memory DuckDB uses and it does not affect the memory use of other R libraries.
Therefore, the total memory used by the R process may be higher than the configured `memory_limit`.

## Troubleshooting

### Warning When Installing on macOS

On macOS, installing DuckDB may result in a warning `unable to load shared object '.../R_X11.so'`:

```console
Warning message:
In doTryCatch(return(expr), name, parentenv, handler) :
 unable to load shared object '/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/modules//R_X11.so':
 dlopen(/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/modules//R_X11.so, 0x0006): Library not loaded: /opt/X11/lib/libSM.6.dylib
 Referenced from: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.4-arm64/Resources/modules/R_X11.so
 Reason: tried: '/opt/X11/lib/libSM.6.dylib' (no such file) ...
> ')
```

Note that this is just a warning, so the simplest solution is to ignore it. Alternatively, you can install DuckDB from the [R-universe](https://r-universe.dev/search):

```R
install.packages("duckdb", repos = c("https://duckdb.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```

You may also install the optional [`xquartz` dependency via Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/xquartz).
