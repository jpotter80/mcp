## Examples

Produce a single row containing the sum of the `amount` column:

```sql
SELECT sum(amount)
FROM sales;
```

Produce one row per unique region, containing the sum of `amount` for each group:

```sql
SELECT region, sum(amount)
FROM sales
GROUP BY region;
```

Return only the regions that have a sum of `amount` higher than 100:

```sql
SELECT region
FROM sales
GROUP BY region
HAVING sum(amount) > 100;
```

Return the number of unique values in the `region` column:

```sql
SELECT count(DISTINCT region)
FROM sales;
```

Return two values, the total sum of `amount` and the sum of `amount` minus columns where the region is `north` using the [`FILTER` clause]({% link docs/stable/sql/query_syntax/filter.md %}):

```sql
SELECT sum(amount), sum(amount) FILTER (region != 'north')
FROM sales;
```

Returns a list of all regions in order of the `amount` column:

```sql
SELECT list(region ORDER BY amount DESC)
FROM sales;
```

Returns the amount of the first sale using the `first()` aggregate function:

```sql
SELECT first(amount ORDER BY date ASC)
FROM sales;
```

## Syntax

Aggregates are functions that *combine* multiple rows into a single value. Aggregates are different from scalar functions and window functions because they change the cardinality of the result. As such, aggregates can only be used in the `SELECT` and `HAVING` clauses of a SQL query.

### `DISTINCT` Clause in Aggregate Functions

When the `DISTINCT` clause is provided, only distinct values are considered in the computation of the aggregate. This is typically used in combination with the `count` aggregate to get the number of distinct elements; but it can be used together with any aggregate function in the system.
There are some aggregates that are insensitive to duplicate values (e.g., `min` and `max`) and for them this clause is parsed and ignored.

### `ORDER BY` Clause in Aggregate Functions

An `ORDER BY` clause can be provided after the last argument of the function call. Note the lack of the comma separator before the clause.

```sql
SELECT ⟨aggregate_function⟩(⟨arg⟩, ⟨sep⟩ ORDER BY ⟨ordering_criteria⟩);
```

This clause ensures that the values being aggregated are sorted before applying the function.
Most aggregate functions are order-insensitive, and for them this clause is parsed and discarded.
However, there are some order-sensitive aggregates that can have non-deterministic results without ordering, e.g., `first`, `last`, `list` and `string_agg` / `group_concat` / `listagg`.
These can be made deterministic by ordering the arguments.

For example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE tbl AS
 SELECT s FROM range(1, 4) r(s);

SELECT string_agg(s, ', ' ORDER BY s DESC) AS countdown
FROM tbl;
```

| countdown |
|-----------|
| 3, 2, 1 |

### Handling `NULL` Values

All general aggregate functions ignore `NULL`s, except for [`list`](#listarg) ([`array_agg`](#listarg)), [`first`](#firstarg) ([`arbitrary`](#firstarg)) and [`last`](#lastarg).
To exclude `NULL`s from `list`, you can use a [`FILTER` clause]({% link docs/stable/sql/query_syntax/filter.md %}).
To ignore `NULL`s from `first`, you can use the [`any_value` aggregate](#any_valuearg).

All general aggregate functions except [`count`](#countarg) return `NULL` on empty groups.
In particular, [`list`](#listarg) does *not* return an empty list, [`sum`](#sumarg) does *not* return zero, and [`string_agg`](#string_aggarg-sep) does *not* return an empty string in this case.
