If you're unfamiliar with geospatial data and GIS tooling, this type probably works very different from what you'd expect.\n\nOn the surface, the `GEOMETRY` type is a binary representation of “geometry” data made up out of sets of vertices (pairs of X and Y `double` precision floats). But what makes it somewhat special is that its actually used to store one of several different geometry subtypes. These are `POINT`, `LINESTRING`, `POLYGON`, as well as their “collection” equivalents, `MULTIPOINT`, `MULTILINESTRING` and `MULTIPOLYGON`. Lastly there is `GEOMETRYCOLLECTION`, which can contain any of the other subtypes, as well as other `GEOMETRYCOLLECTION`s recursively.", "position": 1, "token_count": 192, "has_code": false, "section_hierarchy": ["The `GEOMETRY` Type"], "metadata": {"chunk_id": "core_extensions-spatial-overview-001", "document_id": "core_extensions-spatial-overview", "position": 1, "token_count": 192, "has_code": false, "overlap_with_previous": true, "section_hierarchy": ["The `GEOMETRY` Type"], "file_path": "core_extensions/spatial/overview.md", "url": "/core_extensions/spatial/overview", "title": "Spatial Extension", "category": null, "tags": [], "section_url": "/core_extensions/spatial/overview#the-geometry-type"}}

{"chunk_id": "core_extensions-spatial-overview-003", "document_id": "core_extensions-spatial-overview", "content": "The spatial extension also includes a couple of experimental non-standard explicit geometry types, such as `POINT_2D`, `LINESTRING_2D`, `POLYGON_2D` and `BOX_2D` that are based on DuckDBs native nested types, such as `STRUCT` and `LIST`. Since these have a fixed and predictable internal memory layout, it is theoretically possible to optimize a lot of geospatial algorithms to be much faster when operating on these types than on the `GEOMETRY` type. However, only a couple of functions in the spatial extension have been explicitly specialized for these types so far. All of these new types are implicitly castable to `GEOMETRY`, but with a small conversion cost, so the `GEOMETRY` type is still the recommended type to use for now if you are planning to work with a lot of different spatial functions.\n\n`GEOMETRY` is not currently capable of storing additional geometry types such as curved geometries or triangle networks. Additionally, the `GEOMETRY` type does not store SRID information on a per value basis. These limitations may be addressed in the future.", "position": 3, "token_count": 236, "has_code": false, "section_hierarchy": [], "metadata": {"chunk_id": "core_extensions-spatial-overview-003", "document_id": "core_extensions-spatial-overview", "position": 3, "token_count": 236, "has_code": false, "overlap_with_previous": true, "section_hierarchy": [], "file_path": "core_extensions/spatial/overview.md", "url": "/core_extensions/spatial/overview", "title": "Spatial Extension", "category": null, "tags": [], "section_url": "/core_extensions/spatial/overview"}}
