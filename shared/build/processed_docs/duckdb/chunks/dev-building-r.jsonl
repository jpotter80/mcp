On Linux/macOS, you can add the following to use all of the machine's threads:\n\n```ini\nMAKEFLAGS = -j$(nproc)\n```\n\nHowever, note that, the more threads that are used, the higher the RAM consumption. If the system runs out of RAM while compiling, then the R session will crash.", "position": 0, "token_count": 183, "has_code": true, "section_hierarchy": ["Parallelizing the Build"], "metadata": {"chunk_id": "dev-building-r-000", "document_id": "dev-building-r", "position": 0, "token_count": 183, "has_code": true, "overlap_with_previous": false, "section_hierarchy": ["Parallelizing the Build"], "file_path": "dev/building/r.md", "url": "/dev/building/r", "title": "R", "category": null, "tags": [], "section_url": "/dev/building/r#parallelizing-the-build"}}
