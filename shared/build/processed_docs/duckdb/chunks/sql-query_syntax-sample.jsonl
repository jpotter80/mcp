This can significantly speed up processing of queries, at the expense of accuracy in the result. Samples can also be used to quickly see a snapshot of the data when exploring a dataset. The sample clause is applied right after anything in the `FROM` clause (i.e., after any joins, but before the `WHERE` clause or any aggregates).
