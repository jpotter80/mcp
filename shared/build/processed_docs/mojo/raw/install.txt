You can install Mojo as a Python or Conda package. This page shows you how to
install using `pixi`, `uv`, `pip`, and `conda`, but you can use other tools.

note Start coding

For a beginner's guide to Mojo, instead see the [get started
tutorial](/mojo/manual/get-started), which includes installation steps.

4. Enter the virtual environment so you can access the `mojo` CLI:

 ```sh
 pixi shell

Verify your installation by printing the Mojo version:

```sh
mojo --version
```

### Add the VS Code extension

If you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or another
IDE derived from it (such as [Cursor](https://cursor.com/home)), we recommend
installing the Mojo extension, which provides features like syntax highlighting,
code completion, and debugging support. You can install it from either:

- The
 [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=modular-mojotools.vscode-mojo),
 for VS Code users
- The
 [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/modular-mojotools/vscode-mojo),
 for users of Cursor and other editors that support VS Code extensions

Or, open the Extensions view in your IDE and search for "Mojo"—make sure you
install the extension from Modular.

[note]
Prior to the 0.25.6 Mojo release, there were two versions of the Mojo extension:
a stable version for working with the stable build of Mojo and a nightly version
for working with the nightly build of Mojo. Concurrent with the 0.25.6 Mojo
release, we've consolidated the two versions into a single extension that works
for both stable and nightly builds.

The new extension replaces the old stable version, so if you have the stable
version installed, you can simply update it to receive the new version. If you
have the nightly version of the extension installed, you should uninstall it and
install the regular (non-nightly) version.

### Print "Hello world"

If you followed the installation steps above, your terminal should be in an
environment with `mojo` installed. To run some code, you just need a `.mojo`
file with a `main()` function:

1. Create a file named `hello.mojo` with this code:

 ```mojo title="hello.mojo"
 def main():
 print("Hello, World!")
 ```

2. Run it with the [`mojo`](/mojo/cli) CLI:

 ```sh
 mojo hello.mojo
 ```

 ```output
 Hello, World!
 ```

### Try some examples

We have a bunch of [code
examples on GitHub](https://github.com/modular/modular/tree/main/examples/mojo).
Here's how to use them:

1. Clone the repo:

 ```sh
 git clone https://github.com/modular/modular.git
 ```

 If you installed the stable version, make sure you check out the `stable`
 GitHub branch (the `main` branch is the nightly code). For example:

 ```sh
 git clone -b stable https://github.com/modular/modular.git
 ```

2. Navigate to the examples:

 ```sh
 cd modular/examples/mojo
 ```

3. Pick an example and run it with [`mojo`](/mojo/cli).

 If you're using a package manager other than `pixi`, make sure `mojo` is
 installed and accessible in your current shell environment. Then run some
 code:

 ```sh
 mojo nbody.mojo
 ```

 If you installed `pixi`, there's nothing you need to do—our examples
 provide a [`pixi.toml`](https://pixi.sh/latest/reference/pixi_manifest/)
 file, which specifies package dependencies and environment settings. So you
 can immediately run the code and be sure you have the same version of Mojo
 that the code is written for. Instead of shelling into the environment, you
 can use [`pixi run`](https://pixi.sh/latest/reference/cli/pixi/run/):

 ```sh
 pixi run mojo nbody.mojo
 ```

## Update

The following commands should update your local `mojo` package if a new version
is available that's compatible with the version you specified when you
installed it or added it as a package dependency. For more information about
updating packages, see the docs for your package manager.

## Uninstall

Mojo is installed as a Python or Conda package, so the normal package removal
process applies.

## What's included

We actually offer two Mojo packages: `mojo` and `mojo-compiler`.

For most situation, you want `mojo` because it includes all the developer tools
(it's a superset of the `mojo-compiler` package).

### `mojo`

This gives you everything you need for Mojo development.

Includes:

- [`mojo` CLI](/mojo/cli) (includes the Mojo compiler)
- [Mojo standard library](/mojo/lib)
- [`mojo` Python
 package](https://github.com/modular/modular/tree/main/mojo/python/mojo)
- Mojo language server (LSP) for IDE/editor integration
- [Mojo debugger](/mojo/tools/debugging) (includes LLDB)
- [Mojo code formatter](/mojo/cli/format)
- [Mojo REPL](/mojo/cli/repl)

### `mojo-compiler`

This package is smaller and is useful for environments where you only need to
call or build existing Mojo code. For example, this is good if you're running
Mojo in a production environment or when you're programming in Python and
[calling a Mojo package](/mojo/manual/python/mojo-from-python)—situations where
you don't need the LSP and debugger tools.

Includes:

- [`mojo` CLI](/mojo/cli) (includes the Mojo compiler)
- [Mojo standard library](/mojo/lib)
- [`mojo` Python
 package](https://github.com/modular/modular/tree/main/mojo/python/mojo)

## System requirements

To install `mojo` or `mojo-compiler`, your system must meet these
specifications.

### GPU compatibility

Mojo supports both CPUs and GPUs, so you don't need a GPU to program with Mojo.
But if you do want to program for GPUs with Mojo, we recommend the following
GPUs.
