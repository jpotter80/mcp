A Mojo decorator is a [higher-order
function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function) that modifies or
extends the behavior of a struct, a function, or some other code. Instead of
actually calling the higher-order function, you simply add the decorator (such
as the `@fieldwise_init` decorator) above your code (such as a struct). The Mojo
compiler then uses the decorator function to modify your code at compile time.

note No custom decorators

The creation of custom decorators is not yet supported. The available ones are
built directly into the compiler.

The following pages describe each built-in decorator with examples.
