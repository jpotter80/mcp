Mojo restricts creating\n`UnsafePointer` instances from arbitrary addresses, to avoid users accidentally\ncreating pointers that *alias* each other (that is, two pointers that refer to\nthe same location). However, there are specific methods you can use to get an\n`UnsafePointer` from a Python or C/C++ pointer.\n\nWhen dealing with memory allocated elsewhere, you need to be aware of who's\nresponsible for freeing the memory. Freeing memory allocated elsewhere\ncan result in undefined behavior.\n\nYou also need to be aware of the format of the data stored in memory, including\ndata types and byte order.
