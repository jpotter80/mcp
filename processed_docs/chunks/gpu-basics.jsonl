It's designed for a diverse audience, from\nexperienced GPU developers to programmers new to GPU coding. Mojo allows you to\nprogram NVIDIA GPUs, with direct access to low-level GPU primitives, while\nsharing types and functions that can also run on CPUs where applicable. If\nyou're experienced with [NVIDIA Compute Unified Device\nArchitecture](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) (CUDA), what you'll\nlearn here will enable you to expand your reach as we release support for more\nhardware.\n\n## Introduction to massively parallel programming\n\nWe can no longer rely on new generations of CPUs to increase application\nperform", "position": 0, "token_count": 199, "has_code": false, "section_hierarchy": [], "metadata": {"chunk_id": "gpu-basics-000", "document_id": "gpu-basics", "position": 0, "token_count": 199, "has_code": false, "overlap_with_previous": false, "section_hierarchy": [], "file_path": "gpu/basics.mdx", "url": "https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/gpu/basics", "title": "Basics of GPU programming with Mojo", "category": null, "tags": [], "section_url": "https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/gpu/basics"}}

Power demands and heat dissipation\nlimits have stalled that trend, pushing the hardware industry toward increasing\nthe number of physical cores. Modern consumer CPUs now boast 16 cores or more,\ncapable of running in parallel, which forces programmers to rethink how they\nmaximize performance. This shift is especially evident in AI applications, where\nperformance scales remarkably well with additional cores.\n\nNVIDIA's breakthrough came with CUDA, a general programming model that allows\ndevelopers to target both server and consumer GPUs for any application domain.\nThis vision sparked an AI revolution when Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and\nGeoffrey Hinton trained AlexNet on consumer GPUs, significantly outperforming\ntraditional computer vision methods. GPUs pack thousands of cores, the NVIDIA\nH100 can run 16,896 threads in parallel in a single clock cycle, with over\n270,000 threads queued and ready to go. They're also engineered in a way where\nthe cost of scheduling threads is much lower compared to a traditional CPU.\n\nHarnessing this hardware requires a new programming mindset. Mojo represents a\nchance to rethink GPU programming and make it more approachable. C/C++ is at the\ncore of GPU programming, but we've seen leaps in ergonomics and memory safety\nfrom systems programming languages in recent years. Mojo expands on Python's\nfamiliar syntax, adds direct access to low-level CPU and GPU intrinsics for\nsystems programming, and introduces ergonomic and safety improvements from\nmodern languages. This course aims to empower programmers with minimal\nspecialized knowledge to build high-performance, GPU-enabled applications. By\nlowering the barrier to entry, we aim to fuel more breakthroughs and accelerate\ninnovation.\n\n## Setup\n\nSystem requirements:\n\n[note]\nThese examples can run on many consumer NVIDIA GeForce GPUs, though they aren't\nofficially s", "position": 1, "token_count": 383, "has_code": false, "section_hierarchy": ["Introduction to massively parallel programming"], "metadata": {"chunk_id": "gpu-basics-001", "document_id": "gpu-basics", "position": 1, "token_count": 383, "has_code": false, "overlap_with_previous": false, "section_hierarchy": ["Introduction to massively parallel programming"], "file_path": "gpu/basics.mdx", "url": "https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/gpu/basics", "title": "Basics of GPU programming with Mojo", "category": null, "tags": [], "section_url": "https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/gpu/basics#introduction-to-massively-parallel-programming"}}
